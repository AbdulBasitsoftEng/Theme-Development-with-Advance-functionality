# Theme-Dev-Project
This theme is a fully responsive WordPress theme designed for modern web development, built using PHP, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for optimal performance across devices. It features a custom post type called 'projects', which allows users to manage and display projects in an organized way. The theme integrates Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to add custom fields to the 'projects' post type, enabling more complex content management.

Additionally, the theme includes a REST API for 'projects', allowing external applications to access project data programmatically. This REST API setup can be used for headless CMS integrations or custom frontend applications. The use of Bootstrap ensures the theme's layout is sleek, responsive, and mobile-friendly.
